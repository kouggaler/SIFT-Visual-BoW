# Using SIFT and Visual BoW model for image classification

This project aims to predict scenaries using computer vision techniques. While there are readily available pre-trained networks for deep learning, this project will demonstrate the use of SIFT and visual bag-of-words model without any deep learning to classify 1500 images into 15 classes. It aims to show that non deep learning techniques can still be useful when there is a lack of computational resources or that pre-trained networks are not available.
